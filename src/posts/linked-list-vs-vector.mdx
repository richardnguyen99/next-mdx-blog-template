# What is Linked List?

A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, where
each element points to the next element in the sequence. Each element in a 
linked list is called a node and contains two parts: **the data* and *a 
reference* (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. The last node in the 
list points to a null reference, indicating the end of the list.[^1]

```cpp
template <typename T>
struct Node {
    T data;
    Node* next;
};

template <typename T>
class LinkedList {
private:
    Node<T>* head;
    Node<T>* tail;
    size_t size;
}
```

# What is Vector?

A vector is a dynamic array that can grow or shrink in size. It is a
sequence container that provides constant time access to its elements. Vectors
store elements in contiguous memory locations, allowing for efficient access to
elements by index.[^2]

```cpp
template <typename T>
class vector {
private:
    T* data;
    size_t size;
    size_t capacity;
};
```

# Linked List vs. Vector

Both data structures are mainly used to store data without a fixed size. 
However, they have different characteristics that make them suitable for
different use cases. Here are some key differences between linked lists and
vectors

## Memory Allocation

Memory allocation is a process of allocating heap memory to store data. Since
they are dynamic data structures, both linked lists and vectors require dynamic
memory allocation to store dadta. However, they use different memory allocation
strategies.

### Linked List 

Linked lists allocate memory for each node separately, which can lead to
fragmentation and increased memory overhead. Vectors allocate memory
contiguously, which reduces memory overhead and improves cache performance.

```cpp
template <typename T>
class LinkedList {
public:
    LinkedList() : head(nullptr), tail(nullptr), size(0) {}

private:
    void __allocate_node(T data) {
        Node<T>* new_node = new Node<T>;

        if (nodde == nullptr) {
            throw std::bad_alloc();
        }

        new_node->data = data;
        new_node->next = nullptr;
    }
};
```

### Vector

Vectors allocate memory contiguously, which allows for efficient access to
elements by index. Vectors also provide constant time access to elements, which
makes them suitable for random access operations.

```cpp
template <typename T>
class vector {
public:
    vector() : data(nullptr), size(0), capacity(0) {}

private:
    void __allocate_data(size_t new_capacity) {
        T* new_data = new T[new_capacity];

        if (new_data == nullptr) {
            throw std::bad_alloc();
        }

        std::copy(data, data + size, new_data);
        delete[] data;
        data = new_data;
        capacity = new_capacity;
    }
};
```

## Access Time

Data access is a crucial factor when choosing a data structure. Linked lists and
vectors have different access times due to their memory allocation strategies.

### Linked List

Linked lists provide constant time access to elements by index. However, they
require traversing the list from the beginning to access an element, which can
lead to slower access times for large lists.

```cpp
template <typename T>
class LinkedList {
public:
    T& operator[](size_t index) {
        if (index >= size) {
            throw std::out_of_range("Index out of range");
        }

        Node<T>* current = head;
        for (size_t i = 0; i < index; i++) {
            current = current->next;
        }

        return current->data;
    }
};
```

### Vector

Vectors provide constant time access to elements by index, as they store
elements in contiguous memory locations. This allows for efficient access to
elements without the need to traverse the entire list.

```cpp
template <typename T>
class vector {
public:
    T& operator[](size_t index) {
        if (index >= size) {
            throw std::out_of_range("Index out of range");
        }

        return data[index];
    }
};
```

## Insertion and Deletion

Insertion and deletion operations are essential when working with dynamic data
structures. Linked lists and vectors have different characteristics when it
comes to insertion and deletion operations.

### Linked List 

Linked lists provide constant time insertion and deletion operations at the
beginning and end of the list. However, inserting or deleting elements in the
middle of the list requires traversing the list, which can lead to slower
performance for large lists.

```cpp
template <typename T>
class LinkedList {
public:
    void push_front(T data) {
        Node<T>* new_node = __allocate_node(data);

        if (head == nullptr) {
            head = new_node;
            tail = new_node;
        } else {
            new_node->next = head;
            head = new_node;
        }

        size++;
    }

    void push_back(T data) {
        Node<T>* new_node = __allocate_node(data);

        if (tail == nullptr) {
            head = new_node;
            tail = new_node;
        } else {
            tail->next = new_node;
            tail = new_node;
        }

        size++;
    }
};
```

### Vector

Vectors provide constant time insertion and deletion operations at the end of
the vector. However, inserting or deleting elements in the middle of the vector
requires shifting elements, which can lead to slower performance for large
vectors.

```cpp
template <typename T>
class vector {
public:
    void insert(size_t index, T value) {
        if (index > size) {
            throw std::out_of_range("Index out of range");
        }

        if (size == capacity) {
            __allocate_data(capacity * 2);
        }

        std::copy_backward(data + index, data + size, data + size + 1);
        data[index] = value;
        size++;
    }

    void push_back(T value) {
        if (size == capacity) {
            __allocate_data(capacity * 2);
        }

        data[size++] = value;
    }
};
```

## Memory Overhead

Both linked lists and vectors have different memory overheads due to their
memory allocation strategies. Linked lists have higher memory overhead due to
the need to allocate memory for each node separately and store references to
the next node. Vectors have lower memory overhead due to contiguous memory
allocation and efficient access to elements by index.

## Cache

Cache performance is an essential factor when choosing a data structure. Linked
list and vectors have different cache performance characteristics due to their
memory allocation strategies. Vectors provide better cache performance due to
contiguous memory allocation, which allows for efficient access to elements by
index. Linked lists have poorer cache performance due to fragmented memory
allocation and the need to traverse the list to access elements.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, linked lists and vectors are dynamic data structures that provide
constant time access to elements. However, they have different characteristics
that make them suitable for different use cases. Linked lists are suitable for
insertion and deletion operations at the beginning and end of the list, while
vectors are suitable for random access operations and efficient cache
performance. When choosing between linked lists and vectors, consider the
specific requirements of your application and the trade-offs between memory
overhead, access time, and cache performance.
